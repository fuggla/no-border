no border
=========

Removes border and fullscreens windows programs.

Usage
-----

Start a windowed program in fullscreen resolution (or a window which accepts resolution changes). Start no border and double click and the program to make it borderless. The list can also be updates by pressing `F5`.

Why another one of these borderless windows script/programs?

Couldn't get other similar software to work with some older application. Wrote a short script for it and then things got out of hand. :)
